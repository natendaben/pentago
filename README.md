#Pentago
## Created by Nate Bennett and Elsa Roeber

Pentago expands on the classic board game of Connect-4 with a twist. This project takes two-player combat to the web, and competitors must race to be the first with five marbles in a row. After every marble placement, however, the player must rotate one of the board quadrants, either to help themselves win or to prevent their opponent from gaining victory. In case the player forgets something, the game is programmed with helpful hints to guide the gameplay. Additionally, users can input their own names for more personalized instructions and a smoother playing experience.

Pentago is a web app built with the React framework and JavaScript.
